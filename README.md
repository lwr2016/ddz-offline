This is a DouDiZhu AI assistant designed for offline scenarios. 
It can be launched by running the QT.ipynb file. 
You need to manually input your own cards and the bottom cards to start the game. 
After entering the game, you need to manually input your own cards and the cards of each player. 
The AI will display the winning rate and recommended hands in real time. 
At present, for this project, you can only play cards according to the AI's recommendations, and we look forward to future improvements.  
This AI model has already been trained by Douzero. Thanks Douzero's team a lot.
